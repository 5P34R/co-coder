# Project Name
The name of our project is MEMOIR. It's a dairy app that works on python with Django framework. The project mainly aims at creating a new approach to writing diaries. This app enables us to create a diary with the title , type its content and save it for future reference. This app works only when a person is signed into MEMOIR. The user registration is carried out by creating a username of choice, entering a valid email, and creating a password with required specifications. This app is very useful to those who practice or have a habit of diary writing.
